Hi, I'm looking to work as a data analyst or an R Shiny developer. I have a wealth of experience using the R programming language for exploratory data analysis, machine
and deep learning. I am particularly interested in Explainable AI (XAI) - the branch of AI that seeks to extract the rationale underpinning the decisions of AI algorithms.
If you would like to hire contact me via gamal.gabr444@outlook.com or call me on 07482993818 .
