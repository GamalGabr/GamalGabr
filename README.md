Hi, I'm looking to work as a data analyst or an R Shiny developer. I have a wealth of experience using the R programming language for exploratory data analysis, as well as most forms of machine and deep learning. I am particularly interested in Explainable AI (XAI) - the branch of AI that seeks to extract the rationale underpinning the decisions of AI algorithms. I am a huge fan of the DALEX package: this package uses an eclectic array of tools to unravel the inner workings of contemporary machine/deep learning models to decode and explain their behaviour. 

My data science journey has been hugely enjoyable, and  if there is one key nugget of wisdom that I have acquired, it goes something like:
