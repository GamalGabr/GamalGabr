Hi, I am particularly interested in Explainable AI (XAI) - the branch of AI that seeks to extract the rationale underpinning the decisions of AI algorithms. I am a huge fan of the DALEX package: this package uses an eclectic array of tools to unravel the inner workings of contemporary machine/deep learning models to decode and explain their behaviour.
